# MobileNet to detect signatures enclosed within the hand-drawn bounding boxes.

This project harnesses the power of MobileNet architecture to achieve precise signature detection within hand-drawn bounding boxes. The dataset, comprised of 49 completed forms, includes signatures enclosed within meticulously crafted handmade bounding boxes.

The approach capitalizes on the MobileNet framework for feature extraction, enhancing the model's ability to discern intricate signature details. This framework, combined with fine-grained localization techniques, ensures accurate and robust signature detection within the specified bounding regions.

I meticulously curated and annotated the dataset using LabelImg, empowering our model to excel in the challenging task of signature localization, proving its effectiveness in real-world applications.

In this repository, you'll find an organic dataset that I augmented to expand the volume of data for this project. By primarily augmenting and expanding the dataset, I increased the number of photos to 80, further enhancing the model's performance.
