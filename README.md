# FCNN-MobileNet to detect signatures enclosed within the bounding boxes.

This project employs a powerful combination of MobileNet and Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) architecture to achieve precise signature detection within hand-drawn bounding boxes. The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of 68 filled forms, each containing signatures enclosed within meticulously crafted handmade bounding boxes.

The approach leverages the MobileNet framework for feature extraction, enhancing the model's ability to discern intricate details within the signatures. The FCNN architecture is then employed for fine-grained localization, ensuring accurate and robust signature detection within the specified bounding regions.

By meticulously curating and annotating the dataset, we have empowered our model to excel in the challenging task of signature localization, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.
